								<h2>Hayden Colson</h2>
                <p id="info">My name is Hayden Colson. I am 20 years old. I live in Santa Monica, California but I'm from New York. I plan on taking at least three nanodegrees in hopes of gaining the necessary knowledge to produce highly effective websites and apps. My main goal in life is to help and serve people. Nothing is more satisfying then being told, "You made my day." I currently work at a restuarant called Urban Plates in Playa Vista where I am training to become a chef.</p>
